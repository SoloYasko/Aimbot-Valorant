## ‚öô How to Setup
- You need to **create** a [Drver Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh5cCUuQfL8&t=1090s&ab_channel=EthanEDITS) and when it's done you put the Source in the Driver folder.
- It's time for fun / use it at your own risk 
- Other question & help / [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DfNCWhFmbv)
###### ‚ùå You cannot use public drivers like mapper because they are old versions. I recommend you to create your own will be the best. 
- We set Source to not re-use the driver. That's why we let you create it yourself.
